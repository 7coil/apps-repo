 ## Features  
 1. Autostart
 2. No CLI-needs after first setup  

 ## Known issues  

 1. FPS Limit isn't working  
 2. libvt (older TVs) not in active development, so only experimental. -> No autostart after TV suspend | maybe EGL bugs

 I'm not a real programmer and all this stuff is really new to me. The only reason this exists, is because I just badly wanted it for any cost. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you can make things better.
