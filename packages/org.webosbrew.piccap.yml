 The main idea of this is, to have a simple frontend app with autostart feature for the hyperion-webos executable firstly developed by mariotaku here: https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperion-webos and also ported to newer TVs here: https://github.com/TBSniller/hyperion-webos  

 I'm not a real programmer and all this stuff is really new to me. The only reason this exists, is because I just badly wanted it for any cost. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you can make things better.  
 **This app is still in very early development.**  

 I think a picture describes what's going on:

 Libvt may not running on all TVs, if you get capture running: true, but Hyperion seems to be black, its an issue with the binary and not this application.
 Limiting FPS currently isn't working for both versions.
